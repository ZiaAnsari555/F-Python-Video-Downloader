Options
Download directory: You can specify a custom download directory by passing the directory path as an argument to the script (e.g., python download_video.py /path/to/directory).
Video format: The script automatically selects the best available video with a height of 1080p or less. If a 1080p version is not available, it will download the best quality possible.
Troubleshooting
Issue: yt-dlp command not found.

Solution: Make sure yt-dlp is installed correctly. You can check this by running yt-dlp --version in your terminal.
Issue: No 1080p available for the video.

Solution: If 1080p quality is not available, the script will automatically fall back to the best available quality (lower than 1080p).
Issue: No video downloaded.

Solution: Ensure that the URL is valid and the video is not restricted or removed.
